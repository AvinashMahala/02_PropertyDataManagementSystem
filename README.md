PDMS (Property Data Management System) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and simplify property management tasks. Whether you're a real estate agency, property owner, or property manager, PDMS offers a user-friendly interface and powerful features to efficiently manage property data, tenants, maintenance requests, and more.

Key Features:

* Property Management: Easily track and manage property details, including ownership information, rental agreements, and unit details.
* Tenant Management: Maintain tenant records, lease agreements, payment history, and communication logs in one centralized platform.
* Maintenance Tracking: Effectively manage maintenance requests, track their status, assign tasks to maintenance staff, and generate work orders.
* Analytics and Reporting: Gain valuable insights into property performance, occupancy rates, rental income, and other key metrics through comprehensive analytics and reporting tools.
* User Authentication and Access Control: Ensure data security with user authentication and role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive information.

## Built With

PDMS is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, leveraging the power and flexibility of these technologies to deliver a robust and scalable property management solution.

* [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/)
